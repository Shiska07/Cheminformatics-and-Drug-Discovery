## Cheminformatics-and-Small-Molecule-Drug-Discovery

This repository contains notebooks that will:

1. Guide you through the process of building machine learning models to predict chemical properties of compounds. Data for the DRD2 receptor is used as an example in most notebooks. Compounds represented in the SMILES(Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) format are used for model training.

2. Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to to create a chemical space using the ChEMBL dataset as a reference. Plot compounds generated by [REINVENT](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent)'s Reinforcement Learning Architecuture into the chemical space for visualization and analysis.
